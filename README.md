## Reflection

This project strengthened my skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, modular structuring, and UI consistency.
One of the main challenges was managing state across pages and ensuring profile and listing data always stayed in sync with the API.
I also focused on creating a premium user interface that reflects a luxury auction platform while ensuring full responsiveness and accessibility.
